A light colorscheme for people intolerant to pastels/concepts/flavor-of-the-month.

This is a highly readable (3.5+ in readability colors) and full contrast colorscheme.

It's meant to get out of your way and just let you read and focus on code. My objective with it, is for you to get tired of it in a year or two, and find nothing that comes close to legibility and integration.

It's mainly made with Asciidoctor, Python, JS and HTML in mind. Other languages are obviously supported, but I've optimized legibility on the former.

Intolerance design is based on Atelier-SulphurPool. I've warmed the tones, and increased the contrast on some colors.

I can suggest https://github.com/ray-x/aurora[aurora] for your dark needs.
